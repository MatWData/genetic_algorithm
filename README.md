# Genetic Algorithm for Employee Task Assignment

### Overview

This project utilises a genetic algorithm to solve the employee-task assignment problem. The goal is to assign 13 employees to 10 tasks in a way that maximises the overall performance score based on a provided performance matrix.

### How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd genetic_algorithm
    ```

2. **Run the Genetic Algorithm**:
    Execute the main Python file to run the genetic algorithm:
    ```sh
    python genetic_algorithm.py
    ```

3. **Evaluate the Results**:
    The results will be printed to the console, showing the best assignment of employees to tasks and the corresponding performance score.


You should see output similar to the following:
```
Generation 1: Best Score = 85
Generation 2: Best Score = 90
...
Final Assignment: [Employee1 -> Task3, Employee2 -> Task7, ...]
Final Performance Score: 95
```
